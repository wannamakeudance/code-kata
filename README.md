## Introduction

My code-kata mainly works in `TypeScript` and `.github/workflows/` folder.

## Steps

- Separate the Item class into a single class file and make type restrictions into the `constructor`

- Make up the `jest` unit tests for all the edge cases

- Add `CICD` workflow into GitHub action so that every push will check jest tests automatically

- Refactor `gilded-rose` following patterns `return early` and `single responsibility principle`

- Add the new item `Conjured` logic and corresponding unit test into the project
